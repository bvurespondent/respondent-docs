## Remote

When `remote` is selected for `typeOfResearch` a project will recruit participants world wide by default. `targetCountries` can be added to optionally target one or more countries

* If a country is targeted, one or more cities can also be targeted in that country via `targetCities`.
* Participants will be recruited within 250km (155 miles) for remote projects selecting a city.

We recommend using [Google Place Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete) to supply the required information for city targeting. We expect the a post including city targeting to include something similar to the code block below. It is important to note that cities cannot be added targeting worldwide, and only cities in targeted countries can be added.

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text targetCities
  targetCities: [
        {
          location: {
            city: 'Seattle',
            state: 'WA',
            country: 'US',
            location: {
              longitude: -122.3328481,
              latitude: 47.6061389,
            },
          },
        },
        {
          location: {
            city: 'Portland',
            state: 'OR',
            country: 'US',
            location: {
              longitude: -122.6783853,
              latitude: 45.515232,
            },
          },
        },
      ],
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Methodologies

When running remote projects the following `targetResearchMethodology` are valid.

* One on One
* Focus Group
* Unmoderated Study
* Survey
* Diary Study

## In person

When `inperson` is selected for `typeOfResearch` a project must supply `targetCountry` and `targetLocationRespondentInPerson` fields.

* Participants will be recruited within 100km (62 miles) for in person projects.

We recommend using [Google Place Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete) to supply the required information for city targeting.

#### Methodologies

When running in person projects the following `targetResearchMethodology` are valid.

* One on One
* Focus Group
* In Respondent Home
* In Respondent Office

## Moderated

Methodologies that are considered moderated must use the `bookingUrl` field in the `externalResearcher` object to pass back a URL where the participant can book a meeting time with the researcher.

* oneOnOne
* focusGroup
* inRespondentHome
* inRespondentOffice
* diaryStudy

## Unmoderated

Methodologies that are considered unmoderated must use a `unmoderatedStudyOrSurvey` object to pass through a URL (`remoteCommunicationDetails`) and instructions (`specialInstructions`) for participants.

* survey
* unmoderatedStudy

### remoteCommunicationDetails

URLs that are places in this field will be appended with URL parameters on redirect to allow partners to collect participant, project, and screener response information. These fields can help confirm which participant relates to a particular survey response. Please see the [URL Parameters guide](/docs/url-parameters-for-project-link) for more information.
