# So what's the fuss about screeners?

Screener questions serve as a brief survey to narrow down participants that match targeting parameters in a project. It is best practice to use between 5 and 10 questions - at least 2 are required. [Learn more here](https://help.respondent.io/en/articles/5489272-the-perfect-number-of-screener-questions). We currently offer the following screener question types:

* Radio
* Checkbox
* Single line text box
* Multi line text box
* Number box
* Slider

## Basic qualifying logic

Single answer or multiple choice question types can have qualifying logic applied directly to each answer. For example:

Do you own any pets?

1. Yes (qualify)
2. No (disqualify)

What pets do you own?

1. Cat (may select)
2. Dog (must select)
3. Fish (may select)
4. Raccoon (disqualify)

## Skip logic

These question types can also have skip logic applied where each possible answer selection can lead the participant directly to a specific question. Continuing the above example

(Question 1) Do you own any pets?

1. Yes (qualify)
2. No (disqualify)
   1. If selected go to **end of screener**

(Question 2) What pets do you own?

1. Cat (may select)
2. Dog (must select)
   1. If **not select** go to **end of screener**
3. Fish (may select)
4. Raccoon (disqualify)
   1. If **selected** go to **end of screener**

(Question 3) Tell us about where you got your first pet.

(End of screener)
