It looks like you're ready to learn more about working with Respondent's Participant Recruiting API.

1. Review [API Endpoints](/reference/projectscontroller_getbyid-1) to get an overview of available endpoints you'll have available to build with. Endpoints will continue to expand and update as we improve the API and add functionality.
2. [Book a time](https://meetings.hubspot.com/rachel-ganon/intro-call?uuid=6ee083e5-8d94-4fdd-bd36-95284cb298a2) with our Partner team to further discuss API implementation needs.

When you're ready to start work on the integration, we engage partners in the following way:

1. Provide [API Staging](/docs/staging-environment) credentials to allow for building and end-to-end testing
2. Support integration partners throughout their development work via email, Slack, and regular calls (as needed by the partner)
3. Finalize partner agreement
4. Conduct pre-launch end-to-end testing to ensure a seamless participant and researcher experience through the API
5. Deliver API Production credentials and support final testing and launch activities
6. Provide ongoing partner account management and support
