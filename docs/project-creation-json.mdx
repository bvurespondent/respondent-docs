# Defining a Project

The following fields represent the most basic necessities a researcher will need to define a project. There are many additional dependencies and conditional values that will be covered in the Conditions page linked below.

| Feature name         | Filed name                       | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Research methodology | `targetResearchMethodology`      | This allows the researcher to select the methodology of their study - this will enable different features based on the selection.

| Target audience      | `targetMarketType`               | Allows targeting of business professionals (B2B) or consumers (B2C)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We also collect an `externalResearcher` object to aid in features like messaging, past participation tracking, and more.

| Field name       | Use case                                     | Required |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `researcherId`   | Participant and researcher reference         | Y        |
| `researcherName` | Show researcher name to participant in chat  | N        |
| `teamId`         | Supplemental information for better matching | N        |
| `companyName`    | Supplemental information for better matching | N        |
| `companyId`      | Supplemental information for better matching | N        |
| `bookingUrl`     | Direct a participant to your booking page    | N        |

# Targeting an Audience

Researchers want to target a specific group of people to eventually take their screener. This first layer of targeting material is what we use to begin our matching process of bringing highly qualified participants to research projects.

| Feature name           | Field name                      | Required (Y/N) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Number of participants | `targetNumberOfParticipants`    | Y              |
| Target audience        | `targetMarketType`              | Y              |
| Location               | `targetCountry`, `targetCities` | Y              |
| Household income       | `targetHouseholdIncome`         | N              |
| Gender                 | `targetGenders`                 | N              |
| Education              | `targetEducation`               | N              |
| Ethnicity              | `targetEthnicities`             | N              |
| Age range              | `targetAgeGroups`               | N              |
