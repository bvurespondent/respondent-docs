# When and how to use scheduling

Scheduling endpoints are applicable for the following methodologies: `oneOnOne`, `focusGroup`, `inRespondentHome`, `inRespondentOffice`.

## Where to start

Scheduling begins with [project creation](/reference/projectscontroller_create). When one of the above methodologies is select for a project, the `bookingURL` field in the `externalResearcher` object is required to schedule with participants. The link provided should lead participants to a page where they can select a time to participate in the study. The booking page should not require a participant to enter email or phone number and should instead rely on the data passed in the redirect URL parameters to associate the schedule with the appropriate participant: `?respondent_profile_id={{%PROFILE_ID%}}&respondent_project_id={{%PROJECT_ID%}}&respondent_screener_response_id={{%SCREENER_RESPONSE_ID%}}`

## Inviting participants

Before a participant has the opportunity to book time they must first be invited to the project via: `/v1/projects/{projectId}/screener-responses/{screenerResponseId}/invite` [\[link\]](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_invite-1). When sending the invite you have the option to send a zoom or other meeting attendance link using the `remoteCommunicationDetails` field. If the meeting link isn't available at invite, it can also be updated during scheduling.

## Scheduling participants

Once a participant has been invited, they will be able to follow the "Book a Time" button to scheduled a time on your platform. Once the participant has confirmed a time the schedule endpoint,`/v1/projects/{projectId}/screener-responses/{screenerResponseId}/schedule` [\[link\]](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_schedule-1), should be utilized to send Respondent the booking information to keep the participant informed.

## Rescheduling

Rescheduling is acceptable up to 4 hours before a scheduled event. After that time if a participant cannot meet a new time requirement and needs to cancel, they will be considered "completed/attended" and incentive will be extracted for payment.

Rescheduling prior to the 4 hour window can be accomplished via: `[/v1/projects/{projectId}/screener-responses/{screenerResponseId}/cancel-booking-reinvite]` [\[link\]](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_cancelbookingreinvite)

This simple moves the participant back to their original "invited status.

## Cancelling

Cancelling is acceptable up to 4 hours before a scheduled event. After that time a participant will be considered "completed/attended" and incentive will be extracted for payment.
