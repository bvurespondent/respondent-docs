# Create the conversation

POST: /v1/messaging/conversations

A conversation can be created with 1 or more participants IDs. In most cases messages are used for 1:1 conversations, but a group chat can be facilitated by adding multiple participant IDs

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Create conversation
  {
    "participantUserIds": [
      "PARTICIPANT_ID_1",
      "PARTICIPANT_ID_2"
    ],
    "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
    "externalResearcherId": "RESEARCHER_ID"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Add messages

POST: /v1/messaging/messages

A conversation ID is returned in the response and is required to add a new message to the conversation. Messages will go to all participants in a conversation. Responses from participants will be visible to all participants in the conversation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Create message
  {
    "conversationUid": "CONVERSATION_ID",
    "body": "Hi there!"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Adding new participants

POST: /v1/messaging/conversations/\{uid}/participants/\{participantUserId}

As noted above, additional participants can be added to a conversation to facilitate a group chat environment. Responses from participants will be visible to all participants in the conversation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "uid": "CONVERSATION_ID",
    "participantUserId": "PARTICIPANT_ID"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
