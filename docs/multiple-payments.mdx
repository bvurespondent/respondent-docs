We provide 2 `screener-responses` endpoints to allow invited participants to be paid the projects incentive amount up to 5 times. For instances where the second, third, forth, and fifth payments may need to be higher than the initial incentive, there is a `tips` field that allows for a payment to a participant to exceed the incentive defined in the project.

<Info />

If researchers are running a multi-stage project and want to advertise the total possible incentive in a research project, this should be included in the project title or description as a callout for "up to $XX incentive". To maintain trust with participants, the incentive defined in the project is the lowest amount a participant will get paid if they complete the project.

If researchers plan to have variable incentives based on quality or time of a study that they will determine after interacting with a participant, the incentive set at the project should be the lowest possible payment.

## How to use multiple payments

It is first important to note that the first payment to a participant will always take place automatically after they are marked as Attended/Complete. Beyond that you can utilize the following endpoints to complete subsequent payments.

* /v1/projects/\{projectId}/screener-responses/payouts
* /v1/projects/\{projectId}/screener-responses/\{screenerResponseId}/payouts

### /v1/projects/\{projectId}/screener-responses/payouts

* To begin a followup payment, you must first call the payouts GET with the desired project ID
* You should receive a response like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text After 1st payment
  [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "profileId": "string",
      "screenerResponseId": "string",
      "numberOfPayouts": 1,
      "payouts": [
        {
          "incentive": 50,
          "tip": 0,
          "totalIncentive": 0,
          "createdAt": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

  ```Text After 2nd payment
  [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "profileId": "string",
      "screenerResponseId": "string",
      "numberOfPayouts": 2,
      "payouts": [
        {
          "incentive": 50,
          "tip": 0,
          "totalIncentive": 0,
          "createdAt": "string"
        }
        {
          "incentive": 50,
          "tip": 10,
          "totalIncentive": 60,
          "createdAt": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### /v1/projects/\{projectId}/screener-responses/\{screenerResponseId}/payouts

* After confirming the current number of payments for a profile ID, you can POST the next payment

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text 3rd payment
  {
    "payoutCount": 3,
    "tip": 20
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
