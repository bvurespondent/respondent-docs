Updating a participant status in a study happens through screener response endpoints.

If Respondent passes a participant with a `qualified` = `false` status your researchers have the ability to manually qualify a participant before inviting them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This signal shows us that their is nothing "wrong" with the participant but they are not right for this project and can be removed from view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If a participant is accidentally invited to a study, they can be uninvited with this call. This will remove their ability to schedule a meeting or complete a linked study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

After a participant has booked a scheduled time on your platform we need the `bookedDate` and `timezone` so that their dashboard can reflect the time they are expected to attend. If the booking URL passed in the project and the meeting URL are different an updated `bookingURL` can be passed with a meeting link in this call.                                                                                                                                                      |

If a researcher cannot make a booked meeting and does not immediately intend to reschedule, this call will remove the booked time information from a participant's dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If a researcher cannot make a booked meeting but wants to reschedule, this call will remove the existing booked time information from a participant's dashboard and let them re-book a meeting time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Receiving this call kicks off incentive payout to the participant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Receiving this API call stops any incentive payment, marks the participant as Rejected Quality, and sends participant an email letting them know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When a participant does not attend a scheduled meeting and is not intended to be given another chance, they should be marked as no show to signify their exclusion from the study. For unmoderated and survey, this API call can be used to indicate that they did not complete the task, but Rejected API call can also be used. Receiving this API call stops any incentive payment and sends participant an email letting them know. |
| Favorite                | Non status related flag added to participant                                                  | NA                                                                                   | Allows researchers to flag a participant as a favorite. This is largely a tagging functionality that can help identify repeat participants that researchers may want to work with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Reported participants cannot apply to future studies from your organization, and we investigate to determine if participant should be removed from platform entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
