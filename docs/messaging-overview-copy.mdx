# What can you do with messaging?

Messaging endpoints allow you to set up a two way conversation between researchers and participants. On our platform messaging is often used to clarify study requirements, aid in rescheduling, and follow up on screener answers. We've found that this functionality greatly benefits both researchers and participants and ultimately helps facilitate smoother end to end research.

Setting up messaging first requires the [creation of a conversation](/reference/conversationscontroller_create) with participant ID before messages can be created.

After a conversation is created additional participants can be added if a group chat environment is desired.

# Why use messages

Messaging is a powerful tool for researchers that helps facilitate pre-screening, booking clarifications, and lightweight study follow-up.
