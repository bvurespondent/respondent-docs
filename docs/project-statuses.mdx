# Managing project status

In each project status PATCH there are 2 key fields that dictate what a project is doing. Each PATCH endpoint does something slightly different with the fields.

projectStatus: `DRAFT`, `PAID`, `ARCHIVED`, `CLOSED`

projectRecruitingStatus: `RECRUITING`, `RECRUITED`, `PAUSED`

## PATCH: /v1/projects/\{projectId}/publish

projectStatus = `PAID` projectRecruitingStatus = `RECRUITING` publishedAt = now expireAt = 1 month from now (project must currently have projectStatus `DRAFT`, project must contain 2 screener questions)

## PATCH:/v1/projects/\{projectId}/pause

projectStatus = `PAID` projectRecruitingStatus = `PAUSED` (project must currently have projectStatus `PAID` in order to pause or unpause)

## PATCH:/v1/projects/\{projectId}/close

projectStatus = `CLOSED` projectRecruitingStatus = `RECRUITED` closedDetails.closed = `TRUE` closedDetails.closedMessage = message // message passed in to explain closing reason closedDetails.closedByUserId = currentUserId closedDetails.closedOnDate = now

If your project has screener responses in `SCHEDULED` or `ATTENDED` status, you will receive a 400 error with the message `Project has unpaid participants and cannot be closed` when you make a request to close the project.
