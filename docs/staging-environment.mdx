[Suggest Edits](/edit/staging-environment)

We currently use a staging environment to allow developers to set up their integration in a risk free manner. The environment is free and fully functional.

Participant API developers should build their integration in staging and then switch over to the production environment when they are ready to go live.

| Environment | URL                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Staging     | [https://api-staging.respondent.io]() |

An example call to the API would look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  curl --location 'https://api-staging.respondent.io/v1/skills?query=comp' \
  --header 'x-api-key: MY_ID' \
  --header 'x-api-secret: MY_SECRET'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing

We will provide credentials to you to log in as a Researcher in Staging.

To test end to end in the staging environment you will need to add a test credit card and create staging participants using the API endpoint described below.

### Card information

| Field                  | Value             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |

| Security code          | 902               |

### Participant creation

POST: V1/Profiles

You can now create participants in staging environment via our API for easy testing using the profiles POST endpoint. Below is an example payload to create a participant profile.

* Participant email and work email will be auto verified
* All other mandatory profile info is set as random data
* You can use this [link](https://website.staging.respondent.io/respondents/v2/login) to sign in as the participants you create to view projects from the participant point of view. and update profile fields to test multiple personals.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "email": "[email protected]",
    "firstName": "Sarah",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "password": "test1234",
    "gender": "female",
    "workEmail": "[email protected]"
