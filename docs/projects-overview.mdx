# What is a project anyways?

A project is essentially the request to Respondent to recruit participants. It allows a researcher to define targeting for which participants they are looking for and apply some basic screening questions to filter our the broad matches.

At its most basic a project will include:

1. A name and description
2. A target population of consumers or business professionals
3. A research methodology
4. A location and other personal attributes
5. Screener questions with qualifying logic to narrow down the perfect fit

For the purposes of documentation and API organization, screeners will be covered in their own section, but are very much a part of a project.
