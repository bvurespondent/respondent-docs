Before your integration can move from Staging to Production, please complete the following steps:

## 1. Staging Implementation Review

Provide a comprehensive demo of your integration in our Staging environment, covering the following **mandatory flows**:

* **Project Setup**: Create and publish projects (including screener questions) via the API. For full endpoint details, see the [Core Setup](/reference/projectscontroller_create) section of our reference.
  * For moderated studies, a [scheduling](/docs/scheduling) mechanism must be in place.

* **Screener Response Handling**: Retrieve and review screener responses, invite qualified participants to studies, and update participant status via these **required actions**:

  * [List screener responses](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_findall-1)
  * [Qualify participant](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_qualify-1)
  * [Invite participant](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_invite-1)
  * [Mark as attended](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_markatteneded-1)
  * [Mark as rejected](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_reject)
  * [Report participant](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_report-1) For full endpoint details, see the [Screener Response Handling](/reference/screenerresponsescontroller_findall-1) section of our reference.

* **Messaging**: Send and receive messages between researchers and participants via our Messaging API. For full endpoint details, see the [Messaging](/reference/conversationscontroller_create) section of our reference.

Once these flows are validated, you’ll be cleared for Production credentials.

## 2. Execute the API Partner Master Services Agreement (MSA)

* Review and sign the MSA to formalize our partnership and credits
* Return the fully executed document to our Sales team.

## 3. Production Organization & Team Setup

* Create a Production researcher organization and a dedicated team for API projects on [Respondent](https://app.respondent.io/signup/?signupAs=researcher).
  * The email address of the organization owner will also be used to receive [transactional emails](/docs/automated-emails). Please ensure this address is a shared inbox capable of handling high-volume traffic.
* Share with us the organization\_id, team\_id and the owner's email for us to fund the account with incentives and recruiting fee credits appropriate for the volume of recruiting you intend to conduct.
