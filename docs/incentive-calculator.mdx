Setting an appropriate incentive is critical to successful recruiting. Through the [POST Project](/reference/projectscontroller_create) endpoint, you tell us what incentive you (or your researcher customer) is offering the participant if they complete the research study.

If you want to share incentive recommendations with your customers, we have a mostly white-labeled incentive calculator available for embedding using the following code:

```
<div class="calculator" data-calc-id="SYB5SRsCnq2hoaNgz" data-type="framed"></div>
<script src="https://scripts.convertcalculator.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>
```

That will embed our incentive calculator into your website, with Respondent attributed as the source (as shown [here](https://respondent.convertcalculator.com/respondent-api-incentive-calculator)). The incentive calculator provides a recommended incentive range based on several inputs provided by the researcher about their audience and research project. The incentive recommendations are calculated using real projects that used Respondent to successfully recruit similar participants.
