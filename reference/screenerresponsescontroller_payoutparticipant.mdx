Used to payout a participant multiple times. Must pass payoutCount to ensure the intended number of payouts occur. Will pay them the same incentive amount again based on the project. Use `GET /projects/:projectId/payouts` to get the payout counts per participant for a project.

Projects Autopay(true): The first time participants are paid automatically when they are marked as attended.

Projects Autopay(false): The first time payment should be done by using the `POST /projects/:projectId/screener-responses/:screenerResponseId/payouts` endpoint.
